                        Nature is the most divine creation of god around us, it is considered an integral part of mankind. Nature has bestowed us with water, air, plants and much more to make us survive on this planet. But are we paying back to our mother nature? <br>The answer is no as we have not only failed in paying back but also exploited nature to a great extent.
                        Nature provides beauty all around, it’s the nature that makes the surroundings attractive and worthy to live in.<br> Human life is possible because of nature and its various boons. Mother nature is a gift of God and must be respected just like we respect and love our mothers.<br>Nature is a unique blessing to us, everything created by God on this earth has some purpose and order in life. The radiant rivers, the shining valleys, huge mountains, blue oceans, white sky, the sun, the rain, the moon and the list is non-ending.<br> All these things have some order and serve a purpose in life. Despite all this, we are still doing activities that are not only harmful but can cause real devastation to nature all around.
